- TASK-001 is fully closed and verified done.
- TASK-002 is fully closed and verified done by manager.
- TASK-003 is fully closed and verified done by manager.

## Active task

None.

## Completed tasks

- TASK-001 — done and verified.
- TASK-002 — done and manager-verified.
- TASK-003 — done and manager-verified.
- TASK-004 — done and manager-verified.

## Notes

- Do not mark a task as done until all test_steps pass.

## 2026-05-13 01:29 — TASK-001 — базовый monorepo/skeleton

Status: assigned
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Manager selected TASK-001 as the first available pending task: critical priority, no dependencies.
- Created handoff for backend agent with scope, acceptance criteria, test steps, and out-of-scope constraints.
- Created assignment lock for TASK-001.

Evidence:
- Handoff: .openclaw/handoffs/TASK-001-backend.md
- Lock: .openclaw/locks/TASK-001.lock
- Tests: not run by manager; task assigned only.
- Files: progress.md, .openclaw/handoffs/TASK-001-backend.md, .openclaw/locks/TASK-001.lock

Next:
- Send the handoff to backend agent.
- Backend implements TASK-001 and reports commits plus exact test results.

## 2026-05-13 04:14 — TASK-001 — backend implementation

Status: implemented, not marked done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Added Docker Compose skeleton with PostgreSQL, NestJS backend and React/Vite frontend services.
- Added backend `GET /api/health` endpoint with CORS for frontend.
- Added frontend foundation page that fetches backend health and displays OK/error state.
- Added README run instructions and local development ignores.

Evidence:
- Backend health URL: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173
- Tests run: backend build, frontend build, docker compose up --build, curl backend health, curl frontend HTTP status.
- TASK-001 intentionally not marked done per handoff/user instruction.

## 2026-05-13 04:22 — TASK-001 — tester verification

Status: verified done
Owner: tester
Summary:
- Located TASK-001 in `tasks.json` and confirmed the required test steps.
- Re-ran backend and frontend builds successfully.
- Re-ran `docker compose up --build`; PostgreSQL, backend, and frontend started successfully.
- Verified backend health returned HTTP 200 with `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- Verified frontend served HTTP 200 and backend CORS allows `http://localhost:5173`; source code displays `Backend health: OK` after a successful health fetch.
- Investigated `neat-glade`: backend logs show the app was healthy, and the later failure-looking lines were caused by stopping Compose (`SIGTERM`) after tests, not by an implementation failure.
- Marked TASK-001 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` per workflow: status changes are allowed only after all test_steps pass.

Evidence:
- Backend build: `cd backend && npm run build` passed.
- Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm run build` passed.
- Compose: `docker compose up --build` built images and started services.
- Backend health: `curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/health` returned HTTP 200 and `status: ok`.
- Frontend: `curl -I http://localhost:5173` returned HTTP 200.
- CORS/API reachability: `curl -i -H 'Origin: http://localhost:5173' http://localhost:3000/api/health` returned `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173`.

Next:
- TASK-002 is unblocked.

## 2026-05-13 12:30 — TASK-001 lock release and TASK-002 assignment

Status: TASK-001 closed; TASK-002 assigned
Owner: manager
Summary:
- Started fresh from repository source of truth and ignored prior Telegram context.
- Inspected `tasks.json`, `progress.md`, `.openclaw/handoffs/`, `.openclaw/locks/`, git status and recent commits.

- Selected TASK-002 because it is pending, critical priority, and its only dependency TASK-001 is done.
- Assigned TASK-002 to backend because the task scope is NestJS backend environment configuration and backend module structure.
- Created backend handoff and assignment lock for TASK-002.

Evidence:
- Clean repository before assignment except tracked TASK-001 lock existed as an active stale lock.
- Recent commit: `f12e7ac test: mark TASK-001 verified done`.
- Removed lock: `.openclaw/locks/TASK-001.lock`.

- Valid env startup: `PORT=3011 NODE_ENV=development DATABASE_URL=postgresql://scale_admin:scale_admin_password@localhost:5432/scale_admin FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 npm run start:prod` started successfully.
- Health check: `curl http://localhost:3011/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"scale-admin-backend",...}`.
- Missing env check: running without `DATABASE_URL` exited with code 1 and included `Invalid environment configuration: - DATABASE_URL is required and must be a non-empty string`.

Next:
- TASK-003 is unblocked.

## 2026-05-13 18:28 — TASK-003 assignment

Status: assigned
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Resynced repository source of truth before assignment.

- Tester/reviewer are excluded by workflow for this assignment.

Evidence:
- Handoff: .openclaw/handoffs/TASK-003-backend.md
- Lock: .openclaw/locks/TASK-003.lock
- Dependency: TASK-002 is done in tasks.json.
- Recent closure commit: c3344d9 test: mark TASK-002 verified done.

Next:

## 2026-05-13 18:34 — TASK-003 — backend implementation and manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend reported TASK-003 implemented and self-tested in commit `3ee0ea7 feat: add Prisma auth access migration` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Manager inspected the Prisma schema, migration SQL, Prisma NestJS module/service wiring, package changes and Dockerfile changes.
- Confirmed Prisma is configured for PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`.
- Confirmed auth/access models exist: User, UserCredential, UserSession, UserInvite, PasswordResetToken, UserStoreAccess and AuditLog.
- Confirmed active-user email uniqueness is enforced by PostgreSQL partial unique index `users_emailNormalized_active_key` where `deletedAt` is null.
- Confirmed migration applies successfully on a clean PostgreSQL database.
- Marked TASK-003 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` after manager verification of required test steps.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-003.lock`.

- Migration: `DATABASE_URL=... npx prisma migrate dev --name verify_task_003 --skip-generate` applied `20260513183000_init_auth_access` successfully.
- SQL table check confirmed: `audit_logs`, `password_reset_tokens`, `user_credentials`, `user_invites`, `user_sessions`, `user_store_accesses`, `users`.
- SQL index check confirmed partial unique indexes: `users_emailNormalized_active_key` and `user_store_accesses_active_key`.
- Docker backend build/start: `docker compose up --build -d backend` passed.
- Health check: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"scale-admin-backend",...}`.

Notes:
- `UserStoreAccess.storeId` and `AuditLog.storeId` are UUID fields without Store foreign keys until TASK-004 adds business-domain models.
- Partial unique indexes are maintained in migration SQL because Prisma schema does not express PostgreSQL partial unique indexes directly.

Next:
- TASK-004 is unblocked.

## 2026-05-14 08:37 — TASK-005 — backend implementation and manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-005 and committed `5d9d807 feat: add repeatable Prisma seed` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Manager reviewed changed files and confirmed scope is limited to seed/docs/package wiring.
- Confirmed implementation creates a local admin user with a credential record and PBKDF2-SHA512 password hash.
- Confirmed seed is idempotent: second seed run reused existing IDs and did not create duplicate users, credentials, store, catalog, or products.
- Confirmed seed secrets are documented in `backend/.env.example` and README, with env override support.
- Marked TASK-005 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` after manager verification of required test steps.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-005.lock`.

Evidence:
- Coordination commit: `01d86fa chore: assign TASK-005 to backend`.
- Implementation commit inspected: `5d9d807 feat: add repeatable Prisma seed`.
- Branch check: manager stayed on `task/TASK-005-seed-admin-data` through verification and closure.
- Changed files reviewed: README.md, backend/.env.example, backend/package.json, backend/package-lock.json, backend/prisma.config.ts, backend/prisma/seed.js.
- `tasks.json` was unchanged by backend implementation before manager closure.
- Clean database reset: `DATABASE_URL=... npx prisma migrate reset --force --skip-seed` passed and applied TASK-003/TASK-004 migrations.
- First seed: `DATABASE_URL=... npm run prisma:seed` passed and created admin/sample data.
- Second seed: `DATABASE_URL=... npm run prisma:seed` passed; IDs matched first run and `passwordUpdated` was false.
- Verification query confirmed: users=1, credentials=1, stores=1, catalogs=1, products=3, adminRole=admin, adminStatus=active, passwordHashAlgorithm=pbkdf2_sha512, hasPlaintextPassword=false.
- Prisma validate: `DATABASE_URL=... npx prisma validate` passed.
- Seed syntax check: `node -c prisma/seed.js` passed.
- Backend build: `npm run build` passed.
- Git status before closure was clean.

Notes:
- Manager attempted an isolated temporary verification database first, but `psql` is not installed in this runtime. Verification therefore used the available local `scale_admin` database with `prisma migrate reset`.
- Existing seeded admin password is intentionally not rotated on repeated seed runs unless `SEED_ADMIN_RESET_PASSWORD=true` is set.

Next:
- Merge `task/TASK-005-seed-admin-data` into `main` with `--no-ff`.
- TASK-007 is unblocked after merge.

- Treated preflight as deterministic repository-state verification only, not task-selection authority.
- Read `tasks.json`, checked dependencies and priorities, and selected TASK-009 as the first/highest-priority valid pending task.
- Chose backend because TASK-009 concerns CSRF protection and rate limiting for web auth API endpoints.
- Created per-task branch before coordination changes.
- Created backend handoff and assignment lock.
- Tester/reviewer are excluded by workflow for this assignment.

Evidence:
- Handoff: `.openclaw/handoffs/TASK-009-backend.md`
- Lock: `.openclaw/locks/TASK-009.lock`
- Dependency: TASK-007 is done in `tasks.json`.
- Preflight: `PREFLIGHT_RESULT=PASS`, `WARNING_COUNT=0`, `FAILURE_COUNT=0`.

Next:
- Send executable A2A assignment to backend.
- Backend implements TASK-009, commits implementation changes, runs test steps, and reports exact results.

## 2026-05-14 19:13 — TASK-012 assignment

Status: assigned
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Ran scripted preflight and received PREFLIGHT_RESULT=PASS.
- Independently selected TASK-012 from tasks.json: status pending, high priority, dependency TASK-008 done, aligned with PRD users/access requirements, and earliest valid high-priority backend task after completed auth/invite/reset work.
- Assigned TASK-012 to backend because scope is admin user-management API, RBAC enforcement, login blocking semantics, and AuditLog integration.
- Created task branch and backend handoff/lock.

Evidence:
- Branch: task/TASK-012-admin-users-crud
- Handoff: .openclaw/handoffs/TASK-012-backend.md
- Lock: .openclaw/locks/TASK-012.lock
- Preflight: PREFLIGHT_RESULT=PASS

Next:
- Backend implements TASK-012 on the task branch and reports implementation commits plus exact test results.

## 2026-05-14 19:23 — TASK-012 — backend implementation and manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-012 in commit `61e1a82 feat: add admin users management`.
- Manager inspected the implementation and confirmed admin-only `/api/users` endpoints for list/read, role change, block/unblock and soft delete.
- Confirmed endpoints are protected by `SessionGuard`, `RolesGuard`, and `RequireRoles('admin')`.
- Confirmed role/block/delete changes write AuditLog entries and revoke affected user sessions where required.
- Confirmed existing auth login/session logic rejects blocked or deleted users.
- Ran manager API verification for the required task test steps.
- Ran approved Docker verification script and received `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.
- Marked TASK-012 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` only after successful manager and Docker verification.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-012.lock`.

Evidence:
- Coordination commit: `71e9c96 chore: assign TASK-012 admin users crud`.
- Implementation commit: `61e1a82 feat: add admin users management`.
- Backend build: `cd backend && npm run build` passed.
- Prisma validate: `DATABASE_URL=... npx prisma validate` passed.
- Manager API verification: `TASK012_MANAGER_API_VERIFY=PASS`.
- Task API checks passed: admin login, user list, role change, block, blocked login rejection, unblock, soft delete, deleted user excluded from active list, deleted login rejection, AuditLog actions present.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-012` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- User creation remains via invite flow; TASK-012 scope is admin list/read/update/block/unblock/soft-delete per acceptance criteria.
- `GET /api/users?includeDeleted=true` can include soft-deleted users for admin inspection.

Next:
- TASK-013 is unblocked if dependencies are satisfied.

## 2026-05-14 19:46 — TASK-013 — backend implementation and manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented admin-only operator store access management in commit `ffa995c feat: manage operator store access`.
- Added grant/revoke/list access endpoints under `/api/users/:userId/store-accesses`.
- Added `GET /api/stores` so admins see all non-archived stores and operators see only stores with active, non-revoked `UserStoreAccess`.
- Grant/revoke write `AuditLog` entries and revoke affected operator sessions after permission changes.

Manager verification:
- Confirmed branch `task/TASK-013-operator-store-access-management`.
- Inspected scoped diff against `main`.
- Ran `cd backend && npm run build`: PASS.
- Ran `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://scale_admin:scale_admin_password@localhost:5432/scale_admin npx prisma validate`: PASS.
- Ran `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-013`: `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Backend verification evidence reported:
- Grant operator store access: `POST /api/users/:userId/store-accesses` returned 201 with `granted=true`.
- Operator `GET /api/stores` saw assigned store and not unassigned store.
- Duplicate grant returned idempotent result with `duplicateActiveAccess=true`; active access count stayed 1.
- Revoke access filled `revokedAt`; old operator session returned 401 after permission change.
- Fresh operator session after revoke saw no revoked store.
- AuditLog contained `user_store_access.granted` and `user_store_access.revoked`.

Commits:
- `f8df28c chore: assign TASK-013 operator store access`
- `ffa995c feat: manage operator store access`
- Closure commit follows this entry.

Notes:
- Duplicate active grants are intentionally idempotent, matching task acceptance of refusal or idempotent result without duplicates.
- No frontend UI was implemented; TASK-015 remains the UI follow-up after its dependencies.

## 2026-05-14 20:03 — TASK-014 assignment

Status: assigned
Owner: frontend
Summary:
- Manager ran the scripted preflight and got `PREFLIGHT_RESULT=PASS`.
- Selected TASK-014 because it is pending, high priority, dependencies TASK-006 and TASK-007 are done, and it unlocks later UI tasks.
- Assigned TASK-014 to frontend because the scope is Login UI, logout, frontend session state and protected frontend routes.
- Created task branch `task/TASK-014-login-ui-session-state` from `main`.
- Created frontend handoff and assignment lock for TASK-014.

Evidence:
- Handoff: .openclaw/handoffs/TASK-014-frontend.md
- Lock: .openclaw/locks/TASK-014.lock
- Dependency: TASK-006 and TASK-007 are done in tasks.json.
- Preflight: PREFLIGHT_RESULT=PASS with docker-compose.override.yml warning.

Next:
- Send executable A2A assignment to frontend.
- Frontend implements TASK-014, commits implementation changes, runs test steps, and reports exact results.

Status: done
Owner: frontend
Summary:
- Frontend implemented TASK-014 in commit `d97318b feat: add login session UI` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Manager inspected implementation files and confirmed Login UI, Dashboard session gate, logout action, frontend session state, auth RTK Query endpoints, CSRF support, shared backend API credentials, invalid-password message mapping and preserved health panel.
- Manager ran frontend build/typecheck and focused API checks for login, session, logout, post-logout protection and invalid-password handling.
- Manager ran approved Docker verification script successfully.
- Marked TASK-014 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-014.lock`.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `d97318b feat: add login session UI`.
- Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm run build` passed.
- Typecheck: `cd frontend && npm exec tsc -- -b` passed.
- Source checks confirmed `credentials: 'include'`, `/auth/csrf`, `/auth/session`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, Login, Dashboard, Logout, invalid-password UI mapping and Health endpoint text.
- API checks against local backend passed: login `200`, session `200`, logout `200`, post-logout session `401`, invalid password `401`.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-014` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- During manager verification, sourcing backend `.env` printed a harmless shell parsing warning for the unquoted `SEED_ADMIN_FULL_NAME=Local Admin`; verification still used the configured seed password and passed.

Next:
- Merge task branch to `main`, push `main`, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-014`.

## 2026-05-14 22:05 — TASK-016 — backend implementation and manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-016 in commit `c6e71e5 feat: add store crud api` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Added admin-only store creation and update endpoints in the existing Stores module.
- Added protected store detail retrieval using existing store-access rules.
- Creating an active store creates a main active `StoreCatalog` in the same transaction.
- Duplicate `Store.code` returns 409 Conflict.
- Create and update write `AuditLog` records with actor, storeId, before/after data, IP, and user agent.
- Operator create/edit attempts are denied by RBAC.
- Marked TASK-016 `status` as `done` in `tasks.json` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-016.lock`.

Manager verification:
- Confirmed branch `task/TASK-016-store-crud`.
- Inspected scoped diff against coordination commit: only `backend/src/stores/stores.controller.ts` and `backend/src/stores/stores.service.ts` changed.
- Confirmed `tasks.json` stayed pending during implementation and was updated only during closure.
- Ran `cd backend && npm run build`: PASS.
- Ran `cd backend && npx prisma validate`: PASS.
- Ran `git diff --check 2440d05..HEAD`: PASS.
- Ran `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-016`: `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Backend verification evidence reported:
- Admin `POST /api/stores` created active store with response `201` and returned a `mainCatalog`.
- DB check confirmed one StoreCatalog with status `active`, name `Main catalog`, for the created store.
- Duplicate `Store.code` creation returned `409` with message `Store code already exists`.
- Operator `POST /api/stores` returned `403`.
- Operator `PATCH /api/stores/:storeId` returned `403`.
- Admin `PATCH /api/stores/:storeId` returned `200`.
- AuditLog contained `store.created` and `store.updated`, with actor and before/after update data.

Commits:
- `2440d05 chore: assign TASK-016 store crud`
- `c6e71e5 feat: add store crud api`
- Closure commit follows this entry.

Notes:
- Main catalog creation is implemented for active stores at creation time, matching TASK-016 acceptance criteria.
- No hard delete endpoint was added because TASK-016 acceptance criteria require create/edit Store CRUD behavior and do not specify deletion semantics.

## 2026-05-14 22:35 — TASK-017 — Stores UI and Admin/Operator navigation

Status: done
Owner: frontend
Summary:
- Frontend implemented TASK-017 in commit `07f41ce feat: add stores UI navigation` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Added Stores UI using the existing RTK Query backend API layer.
- Added role-aware navigation: admin sees store management actions; operator sees assigned-stores navigation context.
- Added store list, store details transition, create store form and edit store form.
- Manager verified code scope, frontend build/typecheck, source-level acceptance criteria and deterministic Docker verification.
- Marked TASK-017 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-017.lock`.

Evidence:
- Coordination commit: `bb17ad8 chore: assign TASK-017 stores ui navigation`.
- Implementation commit inspected: `07f41ce feat: add stores UI navigation`.
- Changed files inspected: `frontend/src/features/stores/storesApi.ts`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`, `frontend/src/shared/api/backendApi.ts`, `frontend/src/styles.css`.

- Typecheck: `cd frontend && npm exec tsc -- -b` passed as part of verification/build gate.
- Whitespace check: `git diff --check bb17ad8..HEAD` passed.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-017` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- UI behavior was verified through source/bundle and API evidence because no browser automation tool was available in this session.
- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.

Next:
- TASK-018 is unblocked after merge/push and after-task check.

## 2026-05-14 22:42 — TASK-018 assignment

Status: assigned
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Manager resumed from repository source of truth and canonical A2A workflow docs under `docs/openclaw/` because root bootstrap files are not present in this checkout.
- Preflight passed with warning that local `docker-compose.override.yml` is active; deterministic Docker verification will use the approved script and base compose file.
- Selected TASK-018 because it is pending, high priority, and its dependency TASK-016 is done.
- Assigned TASK-018 to backend because the scope is Store Details API, active StoreCatalog lookup, overview response, and server-side access checks.
- Created task branch, lock, and backend handoff.

Evidence:
- Branch: `task/TASK-018-store-details-api`
- Handoff: `.openclaw/handoffs/TASK-018-backend.md`

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-018 in commit `e213ee5 feat: add store details endpoint` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Added `GET /api/stores/:storeId/details` behind existing session, role and store-access guards.
- Details response includes store, activeCatalog, overview, currentVersionId, scales summary and recent sync logs section.
- Admin can open any store; operator can open only stores with active assigned access.
- Manager verified code scope, backend build, Prisma schema, source-level acceptance criteria and deterministic Docker verification.
- Marked TASK-018 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-018.lock`.

Evidence:
- Coordination commit: `4b6a55f chore: assign TASK-018 store details api`.
- Implementation commit inspected: `e213ee5 feat: add store details endpoint`.

- Backend reported focused API checks: admin details `200`, assigned operator details `200`, foreign operator details `403`, active catalog present and matched DB.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-018` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- If a store has no active `StoreCatalog`, details returns 404 `Active store catalog not found`, preserving the task requirement that Store Details return an active catalog.
- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.

Next:
- Merge task branch to `main`, push `main` and task branch, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-018`.

## 2026-05-15 00:08 — TASK-019 — ScaleDevice registration and token management

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-019 in commit `d0d5f2d feat: add scale device token management` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Added admin-only ScaleDevice registration endpoint for store devices.
- Added status management for active/inactive/blocked/archived devices.
- Added apiToken regeneration that stores only `apiTokenHash` and invalidates the old token hash.
- Create/regenerate responses return `apiToken` once and omit `apiTokenHash` from device responses.
- Device operations write AuditLog entries without plaintext tokens or apiTokenHash values.
- Manager verified code scope, build, Prisma schema, source-level acceptance criteria, backend-reported API/DB checks, and deterministic Docker verification.
- Marked TASK-019 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-019` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- Device self-auth endpoint was not added; TASK-019 covers admin registration/status/token management and token rotation semantics.
- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.

Next:
- Merge task branch to `main`, push `main` and task branch, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-019`.

## 2026-05-15 03:05 — TASK-021 — Product master catalog CRUD/search/audit

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-021 in commit `aee7062 feat: add product master CRUD` without marking `tasks.json` done.

- Added required validation for `defaultPluCode`, `name`, `shortName`, `unit` and `status`.
- Enforced `defaultPluCode` uniqueness with conflict response.
- Search supports `name`, `shortName`, `defaultPluCode`, `sku` and `barcode`.
- Archived products are returned with `unavailableForNewActivePlacements=true` for later placement logic.
- Updating products used by active catalog placements returns `PRODUCT_USED_IN_ACTIVE_CATALOG_PLACEMENTS` warning metadata.
- Product create/update writes AuditLog entries with before/after data.
- Manager verified code scope, backend build, Prisma schema, backend-reported API/DB checks and deterministic Docker verification.
- Marked TASK-021 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

- Used-product confirmation is implemented as a warning-on-update flow, satisfying the warning/confirmation acceptance criterion.

Next:
- Merge task branch to `main`, push `main` and task branch, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-021`.

## 2026-05-15 05:00 — TASK-023 — Category CRUD tree manager closure

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented Category CRUD/tree/reorder/status support for active StoreCatalog in commit `066e77e`.
- Manager inspected the implementation and confirmed scope is limited to backend catalog module/controller/service plus expected handoff/lock files.
- Confirmed store access guards, active catalog lookup, same-catalog parent validation, max depth 3, cycle prevention, sibling sortOrder reorder, category status semantics, and AuditLog writes for category changes.
- Verified backend build and Prisma schema validation.
- Ran required Docker verification script successfully.

Notes:
- Docker verification emitted a non-blocking warning: Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx is not installed.
- Placement APIs are not in TASK-023 scope; archived category support is exposed through status and `canAcceptActivePlacements: false` for later TASK-025 integration.

Next:
- TASK-024 or another eligible pending task can be selected only after after-task check passes and this task receives a final report.

## 2026-05-15 07:21 — TASK-025 — CatalogProductPlacement CRUD and move flow

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:

- Merge task branch to `main`, push `main` and the task branch, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-025`.

## 2026-05-15 08:39 — TASK-027 — StoreProductPrice API

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Backend implemented TASK-027 in commit `e91838a TASK-027 implement store product price API` without marking `tasks.json` done.
- Added protected Prices API scoped to a store active catalog and existing store access guards.
- Added list response for active-catalog placed products with product data, category data, current active price and `missingPrice` indicator.
- Added price set/upsert endpoints with `price > 0` validation and default `RUB` currency.
- Enforced MVP one active price per store/product in service logic by updating the primary active price and archiving duplicate active rows if found.
- Confirmed Product rows are not modified by price changes.
- Price changes write AuditLog entries.
- Manager verified code scope, backend build, Prisma schema validation, source-level acceptance criteria and deterministic Docker verification.
- Marked TASK-027 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.
- Released `.openclaw/locks/TASK-027.lock`.

Evidence:
- Coordination commit: `66f52f9 chore: assign TASK-027 store product price api`.
- Implementation commit inspected: `e91838a TASK-027 implement store product price API`.

Status: done
Owner: backend
Summary:
- Added atomic backend publishing for active store catalogs via guarded `POST /api/stores/:storeId/publishing/catalog-publish`.
- Publishing validates first; blocking errors prevent CatalogVersion creation.
- Successful publish creates immutable `CatalogVersion`, increments `versionNumber` inside `catalogId`, updates `StoreCatalog.currentVersionId`, and writes `AuditLog` inside one transaction.
- Rollback behavior is covered by focused verification; simulated failure after version creation leaves previous `currentVersionId` unchanged.
- Confirmed no ordinary CatalogVersion update/delete API was added.
- Marked TASK-035 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `282079f TASK-035 implement atomic catalog publishing`.

## 2026-05-15T19:02:10+02:00 — TASK-046 — production Docker Compose and deployment notes

Status: done
Owner: backend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Added production-oriented Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL, backend and frontend with persistent uploaded-files volume mounted at `/app/uploads`.
- Added `FILE_UPLOAD_DIR` to the backend env example and documented production environment requirements without real secrets.
- Documented local uploaded-file serving via `/uploads/`, PostgreSQL dump commands, uploaded-files backup/copy commands and HTTPS/TLS reverse proxy requirement for production cookies.
- Manager inspected scope and confirmed changes are limited to TASK-046 infrastructure/docs files.
- Marked TASK-046 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `53074c9 TASK-046 add production deployment compose notes`.

## 2026-05-16 13:02 — TASK-047 — BUG-001 production invite token response fix

Status: done
Owner: backend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Updated create-invite response handling so production responses include invite metadata but omit the top-level plain invite token.
- Kept non-production create-invite token return for local/manual testing, matching the existing password-reset production pattern.
- Updated Users & Access invite UI/types to tolerate absent `response.token` and show a safe production success message.
- Updated BUG-001 status to Fixed after focused verification.
- Manager inspected scope and confirmed changes are limited to allowed TASK-047 source/docs/progress files.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `f549f29 fix: hide production invite token response`.
- Changed files inspected: `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`, `frontend/src/features/users/usersApi.ts`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`, `docs/bugs/BUG-001.md`, `progress.md`.
- Whitespace check: `git diff --check main...HEAD` passed.
- Backend build: `npm --prefix backend run build` passed.
- Frontend build: `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- Prisma validate: `cd backend && npx prisma validate --schema prisma/schema.prisma` passed.
- Focused manager source check returned `TASK_047_MANAGER_SOURCE_CHECK=PASS`.
- Focused production response shape check passed: response keys are `["invite"]`; invite keys are `["acceptedAt","createdAt","email","expiresAt","id","role"]`; token-equivalent top-level keys found: `[]`.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-047` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- `scripts/openclaw-preflight.sh` is limited for this explicit post-UAT task because TASK-047 is not in historical `tasks.json` and the workflow-required TASK-047 lock/task branch makes the script report failures. Historical TASK-001..TASK-046 statuses were not edited.
- Live HTTP admin create-invite shape check could not authenticate with example seed credentials against the current Docker database; no production secrets were read or printed. Verification used Docker build/start plus focused source/service response-shape evidence.
- Runtime `.openclaw/locks/`, `.openclaw/handoffs/`, and `.openclaw/runtime-audit/` artifacts were kept uncommitted.

Next:
- Merge task branch to main, push main and task branch, remove runtime lock, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-047` if supported; otherwise record the post-UAT gate limitation.

## 2026-05-16 20:22 — TASK-048 — frontend auth/session cache clearing

Status: done
Owner: frontend
Summary:
- Implemented frontend auth/session state recovery for logout and session invalidation.
- Successful logout now resets RTK Query API state so protected cached data, dashboard, and protected navigation clear immediately.
- `/api/auth/session` 401 now resolves to unauthenticated session state and renders Login instead of retaining stale dashboard UI.
- Protected endpoint 401 responses reset RTK Query state for protected data.
- Logout clears protected hash navigation after success.
- CSRF login/logout behavior preserved.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit: `e34d0d6 fix frontend auth session cache clearing`.
- Changed files reviewed: `frontend/src/features/auth/authApi.ts`, `frontend/src/shared/api/backendApi.ts`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`.

## 2026-05-16 20:27 — TASK-049 — multi-tab logout CSRF/session broadcast

Status: done
Owner: frontend
Summary:
- Implemented multi-tab auth/session broadcast using BroadcastChannel with localStorage fallback.
- Logout now clears protected RTK Query cache and protected hash navigation across open tabs.
- Logout is idempotent when the session is already unauthenticated.
- Stale CSRF 403 during logout refreshes CSRF and retries once.
- Protected 401 responses broadcast stale protected UI clearing to other tabs.
- Preserved TASK-048 logout/session cache clearing behavior.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit: `31b8ec7 TASK-049 frontend multi-tab logout handling`.

## 2026-05-16T20:34:07+02:00 — TASK-050 — protected 401 session handling

Status: done
Owner: frontend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Frontend implemented normalized protected 401 handling in commit `9d79fc2 TASK-050 handle session 401 as protected state loss`.
- `/auth/session` 401 responses now clear protected RTK Query state instead of being excluded, allowing mounted SPA session invalidation to reset protected caches, clear protected navigation hash, broadcast `session-cleared`, and render login.
- Preserved exclusions for `/auth/csrf`, `/auth/login`, and `/auth/logout` so login failures and logout handling remain isolated.
- Manager inspected scope and confirmed only `frontend/src/shared/api/backendApi.ts` changed.
- Marked TASK-050 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `9d79fc2 TASK-050 handle session 401 as protected state loss`.

## 2026-05-16T20:44:37+02:00 — TASK-056 — catalog route ID safety and cache refresh

Status: done
Owner: frontend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Added UUID-shaped validation for malformed or empty store/product hash route IDs.
- Invalid `#store:`, `#store-edit:` and `#product-edit:` links now render a safe not-found panel instead of issuing detail/edit queries with bad IDs.
- Store/product detail/edit routes use current RTK Query data so stale previous records are not shown after route errors or argument changes.
- Product and category mutations now invalidate related catalog placement, prices and publishing caches so PATCH updates are reflected in the UI and preserved after refresh.
- Manager inspected implementation scope and confirmed only TASK-056 frontend files changed.
- Marked TASK-056 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `7f36cef TASK-056 harden catalog route IDs`.
- Changed files inspected: `frontend/src/main.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/products/productsApi.ts`, `frontend/src/features/catalog/catalogApi.ts`.

## 2026-05-16T20:52:39+02:00 — TASK-057 — Global Logs responsive layout

Status: done
Owner: frontend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Fixed Global Logs responsive CSS so log containers can shrink within mobile/tablet viewports.
- Filters now use bounded mobile columns and can scroll inside their container.
- Log cards and table wrappers are constrained to viewport width; wide log tables retain internal horizontal scrolling instead of causing page-level overflow.
- Manager inspected scope and confirmed implementation stayed inside TASK-057 frontend responsive layout scope.
- Marked TASK-057 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `e23b09e TASK-057 Fix global logs responsive layout`.
- Changed files inspected: `frontend/src/styles.css`.
- Focused static responsive evidence: filters use `minmax(min(180px, 100%), 1fr)`; filters have `overflow-x: auto`; log cards use `min-width: 0` and `max-width: 100%`; table wrappers use `max-width: 100%` and `overflow-x: auto`; log tables retain internal `min-width: 860px`.
- Whitespace check: `git diff --check main...HEAD` passed.
- Frontend build: `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- Frontend typecheck: `cd frontend && npm exec tsc -- -b` passed.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-057` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- Live viewport browser testing was not available in the delegated runtime, so manager accepted focused static CSS evidence plus build/typecheck/Docker verification for the responsive constraints.
- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.
- Docker verification emitted a non-blocking warning: Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx is not installed.

Next:
- Merge task branch to main, push main and task branch, remove runtime lock, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-057`.

- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.
- Docker verification emitted a non-blocking warning: Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx is not installed.
- Runtime `.openclaw/locks/`, `.openclaw/handoffs/`, and `.openclaw/runtime-audit/` artifacts were kept uncommitted.

Next:
- Merge task branch to main, push main and task branch, remove runtime lock, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-058`.

## 2026-05-16T21:22:00+02:00 — TASK-051 — store list cross-tab revalidation

Status: done
Owner: frontend (manager-bound subagent)
Summary:
- Added frontend cross-tab store-list change events using BroadcastChannel with localStorage fallback.
- Store create/update mutations now publish a store-list changed event only after successful mutation completion.
- The app subscribes to store-list events and invalidates the RTK Query `Stores/LIST` cache so other tabs revalidate without hard refresh.
- Store list views now refetch on focus, reconnect and remount/route return to cover back-forward and route return behavior.
- Manager inspected scope and confirmed changes stayed within TASK-051 frontend store-list cache/revalidation scope.
- Marked TASK-051 `status` as `done` after manager verification and Docker verification passed.

Evidence:
- Implementation commit inspected: `5342dc8 TASK-051 revalidate store list across tabs`.
- Changed files inspected: `frontend/src/shared/api/backendApi.ts`, `frontend/src/features/stores/storesApi.ts`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- Whitespace check: `git diff --check` passed.
- Frontend build: `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- Frontend typecheck: `cd frontend && npm exec tsc -- -b` passed.
- Docker verification: `scripts/openclaw-docker-verify.sh TASK-051` returned `DOCKER_VERIFY_RESULT=PASS`.

Notes:
- Docker verification ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` as required by workflow.
- Docker verification emitted a non-blocking warning: Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx is not installed.
- Runtime `.openclaw/locks/`, `.openclaw/handoffs/`, and `.openclaw/runtime-audit/` artifacts were kept uncommitted.

Next:
- Merge task branch to main, push main and task branch, remove runtime lock, then run `scripts/openclaw-after-task-check.sh TASK-051`.
